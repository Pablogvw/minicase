# Evidence 2: Integrative blog
In the class at the beginning I was very skeptical about programming things, I didn't like it and the truth was that I wasn't interested in it. When we were working on it during the class and we saw the different uses that it can be given and how technologies can help you to predict and even make important decision-making easier for people in senior management of a company.
What made me more interesting was the various utilities that you can give to the different programs. A very entertaining class!
